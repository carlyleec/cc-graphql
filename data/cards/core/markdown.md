### Paradigms, Patterns, and Ideas
The simple beauty of the Unix Philosophy defines the core of my development ethos. Values like simplicity and composability found in the Unix Philosophy are also key tenants in the Functional Programming paradigm, and my development style tends toward the Functional with a focus on pure functions, recursion, immutability, and using higher order functions. When necessary, I also make use of the Object Oriented paradigm to model objects with classes, encapsulate data access methods, and provide polymorphic interfaces. My approach to development is an iterative process driven by usability, where user testing is the measure that defines application performance.

### Protocols, APIs and Architectures
Whether building or consuming APIs, HTTP is at the center of communication on the web. I have a deep understanding of HTTP and how it relates to building RESTful APIs for interacting with data. While REST APIs aren’t going away anytime soon, I think that GraphQL is the future of APIs, and I would encourage any new project to use GraphQL even if it is ultimately backed by a REST API. In addition, I’m familiar with a variety architectures, including client-server, multi-tier, and micro-services. I’m particularly excited about serverless micro-service architectures such as AWS’s Lambda for building REST and GraphQL APIs, as well performing maintenance tasks such as ETL jobs.
