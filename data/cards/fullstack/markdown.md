Design isn’t screen deep. It extends through the entire technology stack, from server configurations to database schemas to developer tools. Choosing the right technology and crafting the right functionality or structure at each application tier is critical to application performance, usability, developer experience, and maintainability. I have experience designing cloud infrastructure for enterprise applications, data structures for databases and APIs, technology stacks for web applications, and data flows within web applications.  The same aesthetic of simplicity and usability can be applied at each application tier to ensure that the entire product is as elegant and as delightful to interact with as the user’s experience on the screen.
