### Overview
I’ve been working primarily in JavaScript for the past 4 years. I have an excellent grasp of the classic JavaScript features like data types, functions, prototypical inheritance, and closures, as well as the more recent additions to the EcmaScript specification like the let and const keywords, lambda functions, Promises, generators, rest and spread operators, async/await, template literals, and deconstruction. As mentioned above, my development style tends toward the Functional, so I try keep my objects immutable and my functions pure, while making heavy use of higher-order functions like map, reduce, and filter. And I'll take unidirectional data flow over two-way binding any day.

### Frameworks, Libraries, and Tools

I use Yarn (and NPM) for package management, npm scripts to run tasks, Babel to transpile modern JavaScript to code browsers can actually use, and ESLint to make sure my syntax and formatting is consistent and correct. I've used both Grunt and Gulp as task runners in the past, but I've been using Webpack recently. Currently I'm using Atom as my text editor, but I've also been using VSCode recently as well.

#### On the front-end
I've built front-end applications in Angular and React, and am interested in learning more about Vue and Ember. I really enjoy using Redux for handling UI state, and Redux-Sagas for handling asynchronous actions like HTTP requests. I also have experience using the Apollo Client to integrate GraphQL into client side applications. I've done client side routing with both React Router and AngularUI Router. Styled-components has really blown me away with its ability to cleanly add both style and structure to React apps.

#### On the backend-end
I'm extremely comfortable building server side technologies with Node.js. I’ve built REST APIs in Express, and GraphQL API using GraphQL. I've experimented with and built some prototypes in both Meteor and Firebase.
