# OneAsheville
The City of Asheville had a communication problem and a really old intranet. The intranet needed to be replaced, and it seemed like a great place to address some of the city’s communication needs. The goals were to facilitate a two way conversion around key topics like wellness, leadership, and benefits, share stories through a blog, and make the Travel Expense form easier to find. We approached the project similar to the way that we approached SimpliCity, we started with user research and a Business Model Canvas. Based on the business needs,  we decided to implement the site in Wordpress, and conducted several rounds of user testing along the way. While the site didn’t solve all the city’s communication problems, the city’s internal blog was a great success and the ever-elusive Travel Expense form was much easier to find due to a prominent (and working) search bar and a simplified layout. One of the most popular features, was a searchable city directory complete with profile pictures so that you could put a name to that face in the elevator. OneAsheville won a 2016 3CMA Silver Circle award.

Unfortunately OneAsheville requires a login, but you can check some slides that showcase the site, [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Inc2yxCDiawHf4Mmo_I-3Prgifzn6XGYF-EGFd92GlU/edit?usp=sharing).
