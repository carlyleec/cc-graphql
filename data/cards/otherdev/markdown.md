### Python
I learned to program using Python, and used Python in graduate thesis to calculate riparian buffers around headwater streams in the Southern Appalachian Mountains. In addition to my thesis work, I’ve used Python extensively to perform spatial analysis and to automate maintenance tasks associated with enterprise GIS administration using ESRI’s ArcPy and open source libraries like GDAL and OGR.  I have a high level familiarity with Python web frameworks like Django and Flask.

### PHP
My experience with PHP has primarily been limited to Wordpress, but I have had some interaction with Laravel. I’ve developed custom themes and post types in Wordpress using PHP including customizations for plugins like Buddypress. I’m completely comfortable working in PHP, and have taken courses in but never actually used Laravel in production.

### Others
I worked as a front-end developer on project with a Java J2EE backend with which I had some interaction. I’ve taken courses on but never actually used in production the following: Ruby, Swift, Objective C, C++, VBA, and VB.Net.
