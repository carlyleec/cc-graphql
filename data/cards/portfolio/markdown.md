### This Site
I'm using this site as a place where I can test out new technologies on the both the back and front end. This version of this site is built in React and Redux with a Serverless GraphQL backend deployed via single AWS Lambda function.

You can check out the code for the React version [here](https://github.com/carlyleec/cc-react).

You can check out the code for the GraphQL backend [here](https://github.com/carlyleec/cc-graphql), and play around with the GraphQL API using GraphiQL [here](/graphiql).

I’m also taking this opportunity to learn more about how AWS infrastructure works together. This site is currently deployed on AWS Cloudfront from an S3 bucket with DNS configured in Route53. I’m eager to explore how these technologies interact with AWS RDS, Lambda, and API gateway.
