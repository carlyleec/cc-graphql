# SimpliCity
The goal was to discover how City employees and citizens were accessing and using geospatial data managed by the City of Asheville, and then create a product that made that interaction enjoyable. We approached the project like a startup, by conducting user research and creating a business model canvas to clearly define our value proposition. Then, we let users drive the development process. After we took our initial guess at what we thought users wanted, we took our prototype to the local coffee shop and literally bribed folks with pastries to try our app. We learned so much, and we used what we learned to improve the user experience. And we kept learning as we repeated the process with real estate agents, neighborhood association members, city employees, and more strangers in coffee shops. Every time we added new features, we went back to the users, and what we ended up was something pretty coolâ€¦ [SimpliCity: city data simplified](http://simplicity.ashevillenc.gov/#/search). It won a 2015 Code for America Technology Award.

I (and my team) was working on new version before I left the City of Asheville that is still being actively developed, [here](https://github.com/cityofasheville/simplicity2).
