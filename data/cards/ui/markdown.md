> “Simplicity is not about making something without ornament, but rather about making something very complex, then slicing elements away, until you reveal the very essence.” - Christoph Niemann

I share this sentiment, and I feel that this site showcases my aesthetic. I designed all the icons and graphics (except the social icons on my contact page), as well as wrote all the CSS. Sketch App is my go-to tool for designing UI components from layouts and mockups to icons and graphics. I have some limited experience with the Adobe Suite, but haven’t used it enough to call myself an expert. I do have a good understanding of UI design concepts, and design guidelines like Google’s Material Design and Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines. I have a ton of experience with Bootstrap 3, and familiarity with SemanticUI and Foundation. I love using Sass, but I have been gradually moving away from it in favor of things like styled-components, PostCSS, and CSSNext.
