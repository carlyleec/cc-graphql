At the City of Asheville, I had the pleasure to work with the amazing Dave Michelson whose usability evangelism has forever changed the way that I approach creating information products. We worked together to build a web app to make it easier for citizens and city employees to access and interact with City maintained data, and we let users drive the development process. We started with user research, which involved sitting down with City staffers and asking them to show us how they answered questions from the public or used City data in their day-to-day jobs.

After we took our initial guess at what we thought users wanted, we took our prototype to the local coffee shop and literally bribed folks with pastries to try our app.  We learned so much, and we used what we learned to improve the user experience. And we kept learning as we repeated the process with real estate agents, neighborhood association members, city employees, and more strangers in coffee shops. Every time we added new features, we went back to the users, and what we ended up was something pretty cool…  [SimpliCity: city data simplified](http://simplicity.ashevillenc.gov/#/search). It won a 2015 Code for America Technology Award.  You can watch Dave and I’s presentation at Code for America for more details on how used usability to development SimpliCity, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P_98VeTlDs&index=4&list=PL65XgbSILalUbldgqtt8e03hN01L4Z978).
