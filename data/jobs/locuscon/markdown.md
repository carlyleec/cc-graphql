- Wrote a customized GIS API for the Google Maps JavaScript V3 API with an interactive layer list, a legend for toggling layer visibility and styling labels, methods for creating markers, polylines, and polygons from GeoJSON, methods for adding WMS and Image Overlays to Google Maps, methods for performing interactive spatial queries, such as finding: locations within radius of a point on the map, locations within a radius of an address, and locations within a polygon drawn on the map, measuring distance and areas, displaying location details, and printing live maps.
- Used the API above to build Google Maps web applications for Locus Technologiesâ€™ EIM Platform and Los Alamos National Laboratories Intellus website
- Used JQuery/JQueryUI to build the UI to perform application logic and  AJAX HTTP requests to a Cold Fusion backend connected to Microsoft SQL Server databases
