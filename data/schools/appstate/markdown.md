Graduate school is where I began learning to program. I was trying to solve complex spatial problems in my thesis research, and I realized that I needed to be able program in order solve those problems. I began with Python, but soon started working with JavaScript to create dynamic water quality visualizations on the web. This led to my first job developing web applications. In addition to programming, I did quite a bit of field work in graduate school collecting water data and measuring riparian extents. I also learned a lot about doing scientific research, geographic analysis, and statistics. However, the majority of my time was spent in the GIS lab developing an algorithm to calculate the extent of riparian zones in Southern Appalachian headwater catchments. You can read about my thesis research here: [The Influence of Impervious Surface Location on Water Quality in the Headwater of the Southern Appalachian Mountains](http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/asu/f/Carlyle,%20E.%20Cameron_2013_Thesis.pdf)
