Attending a liberal arts university was one of the best decisions that I have made. My studies focused on Geology and Environmental Science, but UNCA's rich humanities program has had the most lasting and profound effect on my life and world view. From contextualizing ideas to empathizing with contrary viewpoints, UNCA gave me a large toolset of analytical and problem solving skills that I still use daily.
