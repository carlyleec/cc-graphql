My girlfriend and I are currently traveling and climbing around the Southwestern United States. Near the end of April, we will be calling Salt Lake City, Utah our new home, and I'll be looking for exciting opportunities in the area. I'm excited about Salt Lake, but it was hard to leave Asheville and my awesome job at the City of Asheville. I'll miss it. You can watch my public exit interview with the City of Asheville, [here](https://digitalsimplicity.io/exit-interview-cameron-carlyle/).
