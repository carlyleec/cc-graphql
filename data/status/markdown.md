I’m a climber and a software developer. I recently moved to Salt Lake City from Asheville, NC. I made the move travel and climb, and to participate in the growing tech scene in the Salt Lake Valley. When I’m not creating things with code, you can find me in the mountains with my girlfriend and dog.
